## General todo:
- More scroll types:
    - Confusion
    - Distraction
    - AOE fire ball
- Scrolls aren't added via &, but as a third part of the map generation process which adds scrolls to leaves, this way you get a reward for going to the edge.

## Known Bugs
- If you kill an enemy when they are on top of a scroll, the rendering is bugged.
