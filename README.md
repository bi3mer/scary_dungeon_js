## General todo:
- More scroll types:
    - Distraction
    - AOE fire ball
- Scrolls need selection built in
- Better inventory UI
- Scrolls aren't added via &, but as a third part of the map generation process which adds scrolls to leaves, this way you get a reward for going to the edge
- Fill in room right before the player gets to it
- Q inventory

## Known Bugs
- If you kill an enemy when they are on top of a scroll, the rendering is bugged.
